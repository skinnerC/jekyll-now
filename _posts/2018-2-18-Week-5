# What did you do this past week?

My partner and I managed to finish the Voting project on Monday. Finishing so early allowed me to go see Black Panther on Thursday night. If you haven’t seen it yet, I totally recommend it! Other than a short paper that I had to write, I didn’t have any other major assignments or test. Sadly, this is the last week that I’ll be able to say that about until Spring Break. I’m heading into a stretch of my semester in which I’ll have at least one test every week. 

# What's in your way?

The biggest thing standing in my way right now are the quizzes. I simply try to get through them too quickly. I’ll pick an answer, click next, and then realize that I picked the wrong answer. There is no going back after you click that next button. Knowing that you made a dumb mistake and not being able to fix it sucks. 

# What will you do next week?

The career fair is Tuesday. I already have an internship for the summer, but I may stop by if I have time. I have a Vector Calculus test on this Wednesday. ABCS will be hosting an event later in the week. I’ll also start preparing for the OOP exam at some point this week.  

# What's my experience of the class?

This week we spent some time discussing functions that accept generic types. This was a pretty interesting concept for me. The fact that all Java classes have a superclass makes making these types of functions easy. With C++, you have to use templates to do something similar. We also spent some time discussing iterators. I never really considered how iterators worked prior to this week.  

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Since the career fair is this week, I want to share the list of companies that will be at the career fair. Before I go to a career fair, I always try to make a little game plan. I’ll write down a couple of companies that I want to talk to and do a brief background search of them. Having a bit of information prepared always calms me down. Good luck everyone! Hope you can land that internship/job!
