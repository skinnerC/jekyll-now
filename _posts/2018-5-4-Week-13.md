# What did you like the least about the class?
My least favorite thing this class is the quizzes. They can be unforgiving. If you don’t realize that you’ve made a mistake until after you click the next question button, you’ve already lost those points and there’s nothing that you can do about. Thankfully, Downing drops some quizzes at the end of the semester. 
# What did you like the most about the class?
I loved the lectures for this class. I’d recommend taking this class, or at least auditing it, specifically for the lectures. You learn about a lot more than just C++ during Downing’s lectures. Plus, they are fairly easy to follow. 
# What's the most significant thing you learned?
C++ was the most significant thing that I learned this semester. It is an interesting, and at times quirky, programming language. Had I attempted to learn C++ on my own, I would know less than half of the things that I know now. I feel much more comfortable having to use C++ during my internship. 
# How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
Between the exams and the projects, I spent around 7 hours a week coding for this class.
# How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
I stopped reading the textbook after we stopped getting reading-related quiz questions (around chapter 18). When I read the textbook, I would spend around 2 hours reading each week.
# How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I likely wrote somewhere around 3000 lines of code.
# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
Before this class, I had no idea what Docker was. It’s an amazing tool. The ability to create a single development environment and share it with group members is invaluable.
# If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
If nothing changes about the tests, I’d like to see the test time extended by about 30 minutes. Currently, it is very difficult to finish a test if you have to stop and think about a problem for any reason.
